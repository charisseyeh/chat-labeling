# 🎉 Electron App Setup Complete!

Your Chat Labeling App has been successfully converted to an Electron desktop application! Here's what was created and how to use it.

## ✨ What Was Created

### 1. **Electron Main Process** (`electron-main.js`)
- Creates desktop window
- Automatically starts your Express server
- Manages app lifecycle (start, stop, quit)
- Handles server process management

### 2. **Preload Script** (`preload.js`)
- Safely exposes Electron APIs to the renderer
- Maintains security with context isolation

### 3. **Error Page** (`error.html`)
- Beautiful error page if server fails to start
- Retry functionality and status monitoring

### 4. **Updated Package.json**
- Electron dependencies added
- Build scripts for all platforms
- Professional app metadata

### 5. **Development Scripts** (`scripts/dev-setup.sh`)
- Automated setup and dependency installation
- Environment file creation

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Development Mode**
```bash
# Run the web version (browser)
npm run dev

# Run the Electron desktop app
npm start
```

### **Building Executables**
```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for specific platforms
npm run build-win    # Windows
npm run build-mac    # macOS
npm run build-linux  # Linux

# Build for all platforms
npm run dist
```

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Automatic Server Start**: Express server starts when app launches
- **Desktop Window**: Native desktop app instead of browser
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on your machine
- **Professional UI**: Proper app lifecycle and error handling
- **No Code Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

5. **Full functionality** → All features work exactly as before

## 🔒 Security Features

- Context isolation enabled
- Node integration disabled
- Remote module disabled
- Web security enabled
- Preload script for safe API exposure

## 🧪 Testing

- ✅ Electron app launches successfully
- ✅ Express server starts automatically
- ✅ Server responds to API calls
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ App packages successfully

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **App Won't Start**
```bash
# Check for errors
npm start

# Verify dependencies
npm install

# Check port 3000 availability
lsof -i :3000
```

### **Build Errors**
```bash
# Clear and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install

# Check Node.js version (needs v16+)
node --version
```

### **Server Issues**
